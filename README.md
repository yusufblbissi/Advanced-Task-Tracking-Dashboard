# README: Advanced Task Tracking Dashboard (Angular & ASP.NET C#)

A big thank you for your interest in the Advanced Task Tracking Dashboard project!

## Project Overview:

This project is a web-based task tracking application designed to streamline efficient project management. It combines a feature-rich Angular frontend with a robust ASP.NET C# backend to create a comprehensive user experience.

## Important Notes:

- Due to time constraints, this project may lack some additional features like environment (env) and configuration (config) files, unit testing, and security measures using JWT and helmet. Fake data is used in the routes as a temporary solution.
- The current focus is on the Angular frontend, with the ASP.NET C# backend requiring further development.

## How to Run:

### Download Angular and ASP.NET C#:
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Install the Angular CLI using the command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Install Visual Studio (Optional) for ASP.NET C# development.

### Clone the Project:
- Clone this GitHub repository to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/Team-OpenTab/opentab`

### Run Angular:
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd task-tracking-dashboard`
2. Install Angular packages: `npm install`
3. Start the application: `ng serve`

### Run ASP.NET C# (Optional):
- Open `backend/Startup.cs` in Visual Studio.
- Ensure the database connection string is set correctly.
- Press the "Run" button to launch the ASP.NET C# backend.

## Additional Notes:
- You can explore more features of Angular and ASP.NET C# online.
